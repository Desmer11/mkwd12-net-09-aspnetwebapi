# Building an E-Shop API - Part 2ðŸ“’

For the purpose of this course we will develop an E-Shop web api. Particulary, we will work on the Categories, Products and Reviews from the E-Shop.


## Requirements:
1. Refactor the code so that it will implement N-tier architecture
2. Configure database to the project (using code first approach)
3. Initialize the database
4. Add e2e implementation for one DomainEntity (ex. Category)
    - Implement repositories for data manipulation
    - Implement services
    - Implement controller with the endpoints


**Bonus**
 - Try yourself at home and implement the rest of the controller that we didn't finish on the class. Anyway, consider that this will be done on the 
 next (Part 3) class dedicated to this E-Shop API.
